| Task ðŸ“œ                             | Stack ðŸš€                          | Time (~ days) âŒš |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Setup a basic dashboard-type layout | React, Tailwind                   | 3-4              |
| Setup the charts                    | Charts.js                         | 2-3              |

| Update the charts live              | Express Router                    | 2-3              |
| Optional - Portfolio for a user     | Mongo(maybe) or just localStorage | 1-2              |

- [ ] Have a darkmode support for the layout

- [ ] Have our own minimal backend which pulls an endpoint and that would emit a socket event to the frontend which will update when there's a stock price change. This would also have a database to store recent historical data so that the user sees some activity when he/she just opens the page.

- [ ] Portfoilo would just include allowing a user to pin some of his/her stocks on interest.

## Hosting ðŸ˜µ

- Figure out how to host the model

- How does the user on the website interact with the model (possibly redirect somewhere else, how to send required stock data and receive the predictions, perhaps an API b/w the two?)
